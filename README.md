# JavaScript Refresher

This repo is my **JavaScript refresher hub** â€” where Iâ€™m revisiting core concepts to strengthen my foundation before moving deeper into **TypeScript, React, and Node.js**.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside
- **Notes** â†’ Markdown files explaining concepts in my own words  
- **Exercises** â†’ Small code snippets for hands-on practice  
- **Mini-Projects** â†’ Simple but complete JavaScript projects (e.g., CLI apps, API demos)  

## ðŸŽ¯ Topics Covered
- ES6+ Syntax (let/const, template literals, destructuring, spread/rest)  
- Functions (arrow functions, default params, higher-order functions)  
- Async Programming (Promises, async/await, fetch)  
- Arrays & Objects (map, filter, reduce, immutability)  
- Modules & Imports  
- Classes & OOP  
- Error Handling  
- JavaScript in Browser & Node.js contexts  

## ðŸš€ Goal
Build a **solid JavaScript foundation** that makes working with **TypeScript, React, and Node.js smoother** â€” and enables me to create real-world projects with confidence.
