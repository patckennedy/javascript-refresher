# 🔢 Even-Odd Numbers Summarizer

A small JavaScript practice project that loops through numbers and summarizes them into **even** and **odd** categories.  
This project reinforces **loops, conditionals, and basic arithmetic operators**.  

---

## 📝 Concepts Used
- `for` loops  
- `%` (modulus operator) to check even/odd  
- Conditionals (`if` statements)  
- Simple variable updates (`+=`)  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (or run with Live Server in VS Code).  
2. Check the console (`F12 → Console`) to see the output.  

---

## 📌 Notes
This is a **practice mini-project** — not a portfolio piece.  
Its main purpose is to **practice logic flow** and working with loops.
