# ðŸ§© Mini-Projects

This folder contains **small practice projects** I built while reviewing JavaScript concepts.  
These are not portfolio pieces â€” they are meant to help me **apply ideas in code** as I learn.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

-   Reinforce concepts from my notes and exercises
-   Practice combining multiple JavaScript topics in small apps
-   Keep code **simple, human-readable, and focused on learning**

## ðŸ“‚ How It Fits in the Repo

-   **notes/** â†’ Explanations in my own words
-   **exercises/** â†’ Small code snippets for practice
-   **mini-projects/** â†’ Small apps to connect concepts together

## ðŸ”— Navigation
