# 🔢 Even-Odd Numbers Summarizer

A small JavaScript practice project that loops through numbers and summarizes them into **even** and **odd** categories.  
This project reinforces **loops, conditionals, and basic arithmetic operators**.

---

## 🎯 Goal

-   Process numbers 1..50
-   Track:
    -   Sum of evens
    -   Sum of odds
    -   Count of evens
    -   Count of odds

---

## 📝 Concepts Used

-   `for` loops
-   `%` (modulus operator) to check even/odd
-   Conditionals (`if` statements)
-   Simple variable updates (`+=`)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (or run with Live Server in VS Code).
2. Check the console (`F12 → Console`) to see the output.
3. Ensure the script is loaded with:
    ```html
    <script defer src="./script.js"></script>
    ```

## 📌 Notes

This is a **practice mini-project** — not a portfolio piece.  
Its main purpose is to **practice logic flow** and working with loops.
