# JavaScript Refresher

![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Progress-16%2F40-green)

This repository is my JavaScript refresher hub ‚Äî the first step in my full-stack skill refresh. Here, I revisit and practice core JavaScript concepts to strengthen my foundation before continuing with React and Node.js refreshers, and eventually learning TypeScript.

## üõ† How I Use This Repo
- Write my own notes in **notes/** for each topic.
- Create small practice files in **exercises/** as I review concepts.
- Build mini-projects in **mini-projects/** to apply what I‚Äôve learned.
- Work on one **real-world capstone project** inside **capstone/** to bring everything together.
- Update the checklist below as I make progress.


## üìö What‚Äôs Inside
- **Notes** ‚Üí Markdown files explaining concepts in my own words  
- **Exercises** ‚Üí Small code snippets for hands-on practice  
- **Mini-Projects** ‚Üí Simple but complete JavaScript projects (e.g., CLI apps, API demos)  

## üéØ Topics to Review & Practice

> üìù **Note:** This checklist tracks my progress as I revisit core JavaScript concepts.  
> Checked items mean I‚Äôve reviewed them and added notes/exercises to this repo.

<summary>üèó Real-World Capstone Project ‚Äî ‚úÖ Chosen: Smart Shopping Cart with Discounts</summary>

**Goal:** Build a production-style shopping cart that handles real pricing rules (tax, discounts, promos), persists state, and feels like a lightweight e-commerce flow.

**Stack:** Start with Vanilla JS (HTML/CSS/JS). Optional Phase 2: React.

### Roadmap (MVP ‚Üí Plus)
- [ ] MVP spec & data model
- [ ] UI: product list + cart panel
- [ ] Cart: add/remove/update quantity
- [ ] Pricing: subtotal, discounts, tax, total
- [ ] Persistence: save cart to localStorage
- [ ] Error states & edge cases
- [ ] Docs + demo GIF + deploy
- [ ] (Plus) Coupons, tiered promos, free-shipping logic
- [ ] (Plus) React refactor with components/state

**Folder:** `capstone/shopping-cart/`
