# 📝 Simple Grade Calculator

A small JavaScript practice project that calculates a student’s grade based on their score.  
This project reinforces **conditionals, comparison operators, and basic logic flow**.  

---

## 📝 Concepts Used
- Conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`)  
- Comparison operators (`>=`, `<`)  
- Variables to store user scores  
- String concatenation for output  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (or run with Live Server in VS Code).  
2. Enter a test score in the script (or via `prompt()` if added).  
3. Check the result in the console (`F12 → Console`) to see the assigned grade.

## 📌 Notes
This is a **practice mini-project** — not a portfolio piece.  
Its main purpose is to **practice conditional logic** and translating rules into code.
