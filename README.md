# JavaScript Refresher

This repo is my **JavaScript refresher hub** â€” where Iâ€™m revisiting core JS concepts to strengthen my foundation before diving deeper into **TypeScript, React, and Node**.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside
- **Notes** â†’ Short markdown files explaining concepts in my own words
- **Exercises** â†’ Small code snippets for practice
- **Mini-Projects** â†’ Simple but complete JavaScript projects (e.g., CLI apps, API demos)

## ðŸŽ¯ Topics Covered
- ES6+ Syntax (let/const, template literals, destructuring, spread/rest)
- Functions (arrow functions, default params, higher-order functions)
- Async Programming (Promises, async/await, fetch)
- Arrays & Objects (map, filter, reduce, immutability)
- Modules & Imports
- Classes & OOP
- Error Handling
- JS in Browser & Node Context

## ðŸš€ Goal
By the end of this refresher, Iâ€™ll have a solid JavaScript foundation that makes **TypeScript, React, and Node development smoother** â€” and real-world projects easier to build.
