# 😄 Emoji Mood Selector (Mini Project)

A simple interactive web project that changes the page’s theme based on the selected mood.  
Users can click **Happy**, **Calm**, **Energetic**, or **Tired**, and the page updates its background, colors, emoji, and message to match the chosen mood.

This project is part of my **JavaScript Refresher** series.
