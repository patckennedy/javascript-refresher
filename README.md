# JavaScript Refresher

![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Progress-2%2F40-green)

This repository is my JavaScript refresher hub ‚Äî the first step in my full-stack skill refresh. Here, I revisit and practice core JavaScript concepts to strengthen my foundation before continuing with React and Node.js refreshers, and eventually learning TypeScript.

## üõ† How I Use This Repo
- Write my own notes in **notes/** for each topic.
- Create small practice files in **exercises/** as I review concepts.
- Build mini-projects in **mini-projects/** to apply what I‚Äôve learned.
- Work on one **real-world capstone project** inside **capstone/** to bring everything together.
- Update the checklist below as I make progress.


## üìö What‚Äôs Inside
- **Notes** ‚Üí Markdown files explaining concepts in my own words  
- **Exercises** ‚Üí Small code snippets for hands-on practice  
- **Mini-Projects** ‚Üí Simple but complete JavaScript projects (e.g., CLI apps, API demos)  

## üéØ Topics to Review & Practice

> üìù **Note:** This checklist tracks my progress as I revisit core JavaScript concepts.  
> Checked items mean I‚Äôve reviewed them and added notes/exercises to this repo.
