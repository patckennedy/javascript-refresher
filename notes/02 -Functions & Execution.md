# âš¡ Functions & Execution

Functions are at the heart of JavaScript â€” they control logic and flow.  
I revisited how JavaScript runs code inside execution contexts and how the call stack keeps track of whatâ€™s running.

### ðŸ“š Concepts Reviewed

-   Function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions
-   Execution context and the call stack
-   Hoisting & temporal dead zone
-   Scope and closures
-   The `this` keyword

### âœ… My Takeaway

Refreshed my understanding of how functions run behind the scenes and how scope affects variables inside them.  
Keeping this clear will make debugging and async code easier later on.
