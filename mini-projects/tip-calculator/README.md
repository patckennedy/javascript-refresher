# 💰 Tip Calculator

A beginner-friendly JavaScript mini-project that calculates the tip amount based on a bill total and a chosen percentage.  
This project reinforces **functions, parameters, return values, and basic DOM interaction**.

## 📝 Concepts to Practice
- Function declarations & expressions  
- Arrow functions  
- Parameters & return values  
- Basic arithmetic operations  
- DOM linking (`script.js` with `defer`)  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (or use Live Server in VS Code).  
2. Open the console (`F12 → Console`) to confirm the script is connected.  
3. As the project grows, the UI will allow entering a bill total and calculating tips.

## 📌 Notes
- This is a **practice project** (not a portfolio piece).  
- Its main purpose is to strengthen my understanding of **JavaScript functions**.
