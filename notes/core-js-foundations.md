# Core JavaScript Foundations Notes

<details>
<summary>📌 Introduction to JavaScript & Setting Up Environments</summary>

### 📝 Learning Outcome

Reviewed what JavaScript is, where it runs (browser + Node.js), and re-confirmed my VS Code + browser console setup.

### 📚 Notes

-   JavaScript runs in browsers and on servers (Node.js).
-   Successfully setup and installed VS Code.
-   Reviewed difference between `<script>` in `<head>` vs before `</body>`.
-   Discovered `defer` waits for DOM to load before running scripts.

### 🧠 Key Challenges

-   Remembering why scripts sometimes fail if placed in `<head>` without `defer`.
-   Understanding the purpose of `async` vs `defer` for script loading.

### ✅ My Takeaway

Revisiting the setup process ensured my environment is ready for hands-on practice and future projects.

<summary>📌 Variables & Data Types</summary>

### 📝 Learning Outcome

Reviewed variable declarations using let and const, reinforced the difference between primitive and reference types, and clarified how pass-by-value works.

### 📚 Notes

-   Variables store data in JavaScript.
-   `let` and `const` are used to declare variables.
    -   Use `const` for values that shouldn’t be reassigned.
    -   Use `let` when reassignment is needed.
-   **Primitive data types:**
    -   `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Undefined`, `Null`, `BigInt`, `Symbol`
    -   Stored in **stack memory** and **copied by value** (safe to reassign).
-   **Reference (non-primitive) data types:**
    -   `Object`, `Array`, `Function`
    -   Stored in **heap memory** and **copied by reference** — changes affect the original.

#### 🚦 Pass-by-Value (Primitive)

When you assign a primitive value to another variable, JavaScript makes a copy.  
Changing the new variable does **not** affect the original.

```javascript
let a = 100;
let b = 200;

a = b;

console.log(a); // 200 (but b stays 200 too — they are separate)
```

#### 🚦 JavaScript Engine Steps.

When JS sees a line of code, it does:

-   Tokenizing → breaks code into small pieces (words, symbols)
-   Parsing → builds a blueprint (syntax tree)
-   Interpreting → runs the code line by line

    Memory Hook: “Read → Understand → Do.”
